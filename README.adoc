# rmempty -- remove empty files and directories

`rmempty` is like Unix `rm` but refuses to delete files or directories
that are not empty.

A regular file is considered empty if:

* Its size is zero bytes.
* It contains only a newline ('\n' or '\r\n').

A directory is considered empty if it has no files in it, except
possibly directory metadata files (`Thumbs.db`, `.DS_Store`) and other
empty directories (up to any nesting depth). The contents of directory
metadata files are checked for magic numbers to verify that they are
not in fact some other kind of file.

Other kinds of things (symbolic links, named pipes, sockets, devices)
are never considered empty.
