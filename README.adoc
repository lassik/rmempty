`rmempty` is like Unix `rm` but refuses to delete files or directories
that are not empty.

A regular file is considered empty if:

* Its size is zero bytes.
* It contains only a newline (`\r` or `\n` or `\r\n`).
* It is a Mac OS Finder or Windows Explorer cache file.

A directory is considered empty if it has nothing in it, except maybe
other empty files and directories (up to any nesting depth).

Other kinds of things (symbolic links, named pipes, sockets, devices)
are never considered empty.
