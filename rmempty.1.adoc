anything valuable.

* zero-byte files
* files containing only a newline character
* empty directories
* stacks of nested empty directories

SCRIPTING
---------

The *rmempty* utility exits:

0 -- all requested paths were deleted
1 -- one or more requested paths were not deleted
bigger number -- other error
